      <p>Hi, my name is Vincent. I grew up in the suburbs of Houston, TX and I went to Texas A&amp;M University in College Station while studying Management Information Systems. After college I worked at Sparkhound, an Information Technology (IT) Consulting firm, as an intern for four months. While at Sparkhound, I was sent to Murphy Oil Corporation to help other contractors with ServiceNow tickets based on SharePoint and help form workflows. </p>

      <p>After finishing an amazing experience at Sparkhound, I still felt like I wanted more out of my career. In college I did some coding, but never really got too in depth. I was always interested in web development, but I needed the fundamental tools to be successful. I was accepted into the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp. After a rigorous 4 months, I learned all the fundamentals needed to be successful in my new career path. Being a recent graduate, I am hoping to find a new career in web development. </p>
